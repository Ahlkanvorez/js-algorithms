# js-algorithms

I'm implementing various algorithms in Javascript using new syntax and libraries from
es7 to learn their strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, implementations might not be
optimized, since they may sacrifice efficiency for novelty and exploration. My goal is
for every example to use at least one new syntax feature or library, but some may use
multiple at once.
